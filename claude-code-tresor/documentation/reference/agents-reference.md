# Agents Reference

Complete reference for all Claude Code Tresor agents.

## Overview

Agents are **specialized experts** invoked manually for deep analysis and complex tasks. Unlike skills, agents have full tool access and work in separate conversation contexts.

**Key Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Manual invocation** - Use `@agent-name` syntax
- ✅ **Full tool access** - Can use all tools including Bash and Task
- ✅ **Deep analysis** - Comprehensive examination and solutions
- ✅ **Separate context** - Independent conversation thread

---

## Agent Coordination

Agents can invoke other agents using the Task tool:

```
@systems-architect design authentication system
[Invokes @security-auditor for security review]
[Invokes @performance-tuner for optimization]
```

**Coordination Patterns:**

**Sequential:**
```
@config-safety-reviewer → @test-engineer → @security-auditor
```

**Parallel (through command):**
```
/review → @config-safety-reviewer + @security-auditor + @performance-tuner
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Context

**Bad:**
```
@config-safety-reviewer review this
```

**Good:**
```
@config-safety-reviewer review src/api/payment.controller.ts

Context:
- Production API serving 5k req/min
- Payment processing with Stripe
- PCI compliance required

Focus on:
1. Security (OWASP Top 10)
2. Error handling and recovery
3. Transaction safety
4. Rate limiting
```

---

### 2. Be Specific

**Bad:**
```
@systems-architect design something scalable
```

**Good:**
```
@systems-architect design scalable notification system

Requirements:
- 100k notifications/day
- Email, SMS, push
- Priority queuing
- Delivery tracking
- Retry logic

Constraints:
- Budget: $500/month
- Team: 2 developers
- Timeline: 4 weeks
```

---

### 3. Break Down Complex Tasks

**Instead of:**
```
@config-safety-reviewer analyze entire codebase
```

**Do:**
```
@config-safety-reviewer analyze src/api/users.controller.ts
@config-safety-reviewer analyze src/api/products.controller.ts
@config-safety-reviewer analyze src/api/orders.controller.ts
```

---

### 4. Combine Skills and Agents

```
Workflow:
1. Skill detects issue (automatic)
2. Review skill suggestion
3. Invoke agent for deep analysis: @agent-name
4. Implement fix
5. Verify with /review command
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Found

```bash
# Check agent exists
ls ~/.claude/agents/code-reviewer/

# Verify configuration
cat ~/.claude/agents/code-reviewer/SKILL.md

# Check enabled field
---
enabled: true
---
```
