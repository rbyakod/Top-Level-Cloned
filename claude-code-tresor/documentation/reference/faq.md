## Skills, Agents, and Commands

### What's the difference between skills, agents, and commands?

| Feature | Skills | Agents | Commands |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Invocation** | Automatic | Manual (`@agent`) | Manual (`/command`) |
| **When to use** | Continuous monitoring | Deep analysis | Workflows |
| **Tool access** | Limited (safe) | Full access | Orchestrates |
| **Context** | Shared | Separate | Coordinates |
| **Examples** | code-reviewer (skill) | @config-safety-reviewer (agent) | /review (command) |

**Simple explanation:**
- **Skills** = Automatic helpers (always watching)
- **Agents** = Expert consultants (call when needed)
- **Commands** = Workflow automation (multi-step processes)

---

### When should I use a skill vs. an agent vs. a command?

**Use Skills when:**
- ✅ You want automatic, continuous monitoring
- ✅ You need real-time suggestions while coding
- ✅ You want lightweight, non-blocking feedback

**Example:** Let code-reviewer skill monitor your code as you work.

---

**Use Agents when:**
- ✅ You need deep, comprehensive analysis
- ✅ You have a specific complex question
- ✅ You need expert guidance on architecture/design
- ✅ You're debugging a complex issue

**Example:** `@systems-architect design a scalable microservices architecture`

---

**Use Commands when:**
- ✅ You need to automate a multi-step workflow
- ✅ You want to coordinate multiple agents
- ✅ You're running a standardized process (scaffolding, review, testing)

**Example:** `/review --scope all --checks security,performance`

---

### How do skills work?

Skills are **conversation-based autonomous helpers** that activate automatically:

**How they activate:**
1. You save a file with code changes
2. Skill detects the change (based on file patterns)
3. Skill analyzes the code
4. Skill provides suggestions in conversation

**Example:**
```
You: [Saves UserProfile.tsx with missing error handling]

code-reviewer skill: "⚠️ Missing error handling in async function.
Suggestion: Add try-catch block to handle API failures."
```

**Key points:**
- ✅ NO manual invocation needed
- ✅ Works in background continuously
- ✅ Provides suggestions without interrupting
- ✅ Limited tool access for safety

---

### How do I invoke an agent?

Use `@agent-name` syntax:

```
@config-safety-reviewer analyze src/api/users.controller.ts for security issues
```

**Tips for better results:**
- Be specific about what you want
- Provide context (production, requirements, constraints)
- Specify focus areas

**Example:**
```
@systems-architect design user authentication system

Requirements:
- 10k concurrent users
- JWT tokens
- Refresh token mechanism
- Rate limiting

Constraints:
- Node.js/Express
- PostgreSQL
- 2-week timeline
```

---

### How do I run a command?

Use `/command-name` syntax with options:

```
/review --scope staged --checks security,performance
```

**Get help:**
```
/review --help
```

**Common commands:**
```bash
# Scaffold components
/scaffold react-component UserProfile --typescript --tests

# Code review
/review --scope all --checks all

# Generate tests
/test-gen --file src/utils/helpers.ts --coverage 90

# Generate documentation
/docs-gen api --format openapi
```

1. **Skill disabled:**
```yaml
---
enabled: false  # Change to true
---
```

2. **File patterns don't match:**
```yaml
---
file_patterns:
  - "*.ts"  # Does this match your files?
---
```

3. **File excluded:**
```yaml
---
exclude_patterns:
  - "node_modules/**"  # Is your file here?
---
```

4. **Need to restart:** Restart Claude Code CLI

---

### Too many skill suggestions - how to reduce?

**Option 1: Lower priority:**
```yaml
---
name: "code-reviewer"
priority: "low"  # Changed from "high"
---
```

**Option 2: Disable temporarily:**
```yaml
---
name: "readme-updater"
enabled: false
---
```

**Option 3: Narrow scope:**
```yaml
---
name: "test-generator"
file_patterns:
  - "src/**/*.ts"  # Only src/ directory
exclude_patterns:
  - "*.test.*"     # Exclude existing tests
---
```

## Migration

### How do I migrate from v1.0 to v2.0?

**Major changes:**
- **NEW:** 8 autonomous skills
- **CHANGED:** Agent syntax (`rr-` → `@`)
- **CHANGED:** Directory structure

**Migration steps:**
```bash
cd claude-code-tresor
git pull origin main
./scripts/migrate-v1-to-v2.sh
```

**[Complete migration guide →](../guides/migration.md)**

---

### What's the new agent syntax?

**v1.0 (old):**
```
rr-code-reviewer analyze this
```

**v2.0 (new):**
```
@config-safety-reviewer analyze this
```

---

## Performance & Limits

### Do skills slow down Claude Code?

**No - skills are lightweight:**
- Limited tool access (Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob only)
- Efficient conversation-based activation
- Run in background without blocking

**If experiencing slowness:**
- Reduce active skills (disable non-essential)
- Narrow file patterns (monitor fewer files)
- Use Sonnet model instead of Opus for skills

---

### How many skills/agents can I have?

**No hard limit**, but practical recommendations:

- **Skills:** 5-10 active skills (more = more suggestions)
- **Agents:** Unlimited (invoked manually as needed)
- **Commands:** Unlimited

**Balance:** More skills = more feedback but potentially overwhelming.

---

### Can I run multiple commands simultaneously?

**Generally no** - commands orchestrate workflows sequentially.

**Exception:** If commands are independent (different scopes).

**Recommendation:** Run commands one at a time for best results.
