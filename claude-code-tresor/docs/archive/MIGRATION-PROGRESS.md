## Issues & Decisions Log

### Consolidation Phase
- **Decision**: Merged duplicates into existing core agents
- **Outcome**: 3 agents enhanced, +283 lines of capabilities
- **Issue**: Source files in git submodule not present (resolved by documenting only)

### Migration Phase
- (To be updated as issues arise)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Create migration script or process for batch agent migration
2. **Week 1**: Migrate core agents (8) to subagents/core/
3. **Week 2**: Migrate engineering agents (60+)
4. **Week 3-4**: Migrate remaining categories
5. **Week 5**: Validation and documentation updates
