<!-- Finance Guru™ Task | v1.0 | 2025-09-25 -->

## Purpose
Parse Financial Structure Assessment CSV and populate user-profile.yaml with personalized data.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Parse CSV Data
When assessment CSV is found at the path specified in user-profile.yaml:
```
READ: Financial Structure Assessment (Responses) - Form Responses 1 (1).csv
EXTRACT:
- Total liquid assets: $14,491
- Account structure: 10 accounts (2 business, 4 checking, 4 savings)
- Interest rates: <4%
- Investment accounts: $500,000 (401k, IRA, taxable brokerage)
- Monthly income: $25,000 after-tax
- Fixed expenses: $4,500
- Variable expenses: $10,000
- Monthly savings: $5,000
- Mortgage: $365,139.76 balance, $1,712.68/month
- Other debt: 2 car loans, student loans (8%), credit cards
- Risk profile: Aggressive
```

### 2. Calculate Derived Metrics
```
COMPUTE:
- Investment capacity: Income - Fixed - Variable = $10,500/month potential
- Debt service ratio: Total debt payments / Income
- Opportunity cost: Student loans at 8% vs savings at <4%
- Portfolio leverage potential: $500k * conservative margin = $250k
```
