Technical Screener Pydantic Models for Finance Guru™

This module defines type-safe data structures for technical screening.
All models use Pydantic for automatic validation and type checking.

ARCHITECTURE NOTE:
These models represent Layer 1 of our 3-layer architecture:
    Layer 1: Pydantic Models (THIS FILE) - Data validation
    Layer 2: Calculator Classes - Business logic
    Layer 3: CLI Interface - Agent integration

EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT:
A "screener" is a tool that filters stocks based on technical criteria.
Think of it as a "search engine" for finding trading opportunities:
- Golden Cross: Bullish signal (50-day MA crosses above 200-day MA)
- RSI Oversold: Potential bounce opportunity (RSI < 30)
- High Volume Breakout: Strong momentum signal

Screeners help answer questions like:
- "Which stocks are breaking out?"
- "Which stocks are oversold?"
- "Which stocks show strong momentum?"

    Technical patterns that can be detected.

    WHAT: Classic technical analysis patterns

        - GOLDEN_CROSS: 50-day MA crosses above 200-day MA (bullish)
        - DEATH_CROSS: 50-day MA crosses below 200-day MA (bearish)
        - RSI_OVERSOLD: RSI below 30 (potential bounce)
        - RSI_OVERBOUGHT: RSI above 70 (potential pullback)
        - MACD_BULLISH: MACD line crosses above signal line
        - MACD_BEARISH: MACD line crosses below signal line
        - BREAKOUT: Price breaks above resistance with volume
        - BREAKDOWN: Price breaks below support with volume

    EDUCATIONAL NOTE:
    These patterns are widely followed by traders. When many traders
    see the same pattern, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
