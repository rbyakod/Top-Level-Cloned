Risk Metrics Calculator for Finance Guru™

This module implements comprehensive risk calculations using validated Pydantic models.
All calculations follow industry-standard financial engineering formulas.

ARCHITECTURE NOTE:
This is Layer 2 of our 3-layer architecture:
    Layer 1: Pydantic Models - Data validation (risk_inputs.py)
    Layer 2: Calculator Classes (THIS FILE) - Business logic
    Layer 3: CLI Interface - Agent integration

EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT:
Each calculation includes detailed explanations of:
- WHAT: The metric being calculated
- WHY: Why this metric matters for risk assessment
- HOW: The mathematical formula being used
- INTERPRETATION: How to read the results

RISK METRICS IMPLEMENTED:
1. Value at Risk (VaR) - Historical & Parametric methods
2. Conditional VaR (CVaR) - Expected Shortfall
3. Sharpe Ratio - Risk-adjusted return
4. Sortino Ratio - Downside risk-adjusted return
5. Maximum Drawdown - Worst peak-to-trough decline
6. Calmar Ratio - Return per unit of max drawdown
7. Annual Volatility - Annualized standard deviation
8. Beta - Market sensitivity
9. Alpha - Excess return vs benchmark

        EDUCATIONAL NOTE:
        The Sharpe Ratio was developed by William Sharpe in 1966.
        It's the most widely used risk-adjusted performance metric.
        Higher is better - it rewards high returns and penalizes volatility.

            "For every 1% of DOWNSIDE volatility, you earn 1.58% excess return"

        WHY IT MATTERS:
        The Sortino Ratio is superior to Sharpe for asymmetric strategies:
        - Investors don't mind upside volatility (big gains are good!)
        - We only care about downside volatility (losses)

        WHY IT MATTERS:
        Max Drawdown tells you about pain tolerance:
        - -10%: Mild correction, most investors can handle
        - -20%: Bear market territory, tests conviction
        - -50%: Catastrophic loss, many investors capitulate

        EDUCATIONAL NOTE:
        Max Drawdown is a measure of "worst-case" historical loss.
        It's particularly relevant for:
        1. Aggressive portfolios (how bad can it get?)

            "For every 1% of maximum drawdown, you earned 0.85% annual return"

        WHY IT MATTERS:
        The Calmar Ratio is particularly useful for:
        1. Comparing strategies with different drawdown profiles
        2. Evaluating hedge funds (focuses on downside protection)
        3. Risk-averse investors (prioritizes avoiding large losses)

        EDUCATIONAL NOTE:
        Beta and Alpha come from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):
            Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Market Risk Premium

        Alpha is the difference between actual return and CAPM expected return.
        Positive alpha suggests skill (or luck), negative alpha suggests
        underperformance relative to risk taken.

            returns: Asset daily returns

    Convenience function for calculating risk metrics without manually creating models.

    EDUCATIONAL NOTE:
    This function is a "wrapper" that handles the Pydantic model creation for you.
    It's useful for quick calculations, but for production code, prefer creating
    the models explicitly (better type checking and IDE support).

        **config_kwargs: Additional config options (confidence_level, var_method, etc.)
