# Finance Guru Public Release Tasks

**Created:** 2026-01-10
**Purpose:** Prepare Finance Guru for public sharing - make it simple and clear for new users
**Executor:** Rolf (autonomous agent)

---

## CRITICAL: EXECUTION PROTOCOL

Before starting any tasks, follow this protocol:

1. **Read this entire document first** - understand the full scope
2. **Work through tasks sequentially** - dependencies exist between phases
3. **Be autonomous** - make decisions, don't ask for clarification unless blocked
4. **Document changes** - update relevant docs as you go
5. **Final step is Codex review** - run `/ask-codex` for full codebase review at the end
6. **Accept and fix all Codex feedback** - iterate until Codex passes

---

## Phase 1: Setup Script Enhancement

### 1.1 Load Finance Guru Agent Commands

**Goal:** Setup script should copy agent commands to user's .claude/commands directory

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Modify `setup.sh` to copy `fin-guru/agents/*.md` files to `.claude/commands/fin-guru/agents/`
- [ ] Ensure directory structure is created: `.claude/commands/fin-guru/agents/`
- [ ] Copy these agent command files:
  - `finance-orchestrator.md`
  - `market-researcher.md`
  - `quant-analyst.md`
  - `strategy-advisor.md`
  - `compliance-officer.md`
  - `margin-specialist.md`
  - `dividend-specialist.md`
  - `teaching-specialist.md`
  - `onboarding-specialist.md`
  - `builder.md`
  - `qa-advisor.md`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- After running setup.sh, user can invoke `/fin-guru:agents:finance-orchestrator`
- All agent commands are accessible via slash commands

### 1.2 Load Finance Guru Skills

**Goal:** Setup script should copy skills to user's .claude/skills directory

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Modify `setup.sh` to copy skill directories to `.claude/skills/`
- [ ] Copy these skill directories (with all contents):
  - `dividend-tracking/`
  - `FinanceReport/`
  - `margin-management/`
  - `MonteCarlo/`
  - `PortfolioSyncing/`
  - `retirement-syncing/`
  - `transaction-syncing/`
- [ ] Update `skill-rules.json` to include activation rules for all copied skills
- [ ] Ensure skills auto-activate based on keywords/intent patterns

**Source Location:** `.claude/skills/` (current project)
**Target Location:** User's `~/.claude/skills/` or project `.claude/skills/`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Skills load when relevant keywords are mentioned
- skill-rules.json has entries for all Finance Guru skills

### 1.3 Update README for Skills/Commands Installation

**Goal:** Document how setup.sh installs commands and skills

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add section to README.md explaining what setup.sh installs
- [ ] List all agent commands that become available
- [ ] List all skills that get installed
- [ ] Explain skill auto-activation behavior

---

## Phase 2: Documentation Restructuring

### 2.1 Move Python Tools Documentation

**Goal:** Move python-tools.md to public docs directory

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Move `.claude/tools/python-tools.md` to `docs/tools.md`

  - Overview of the 3-layer architecture (Pydantic → Calculator → CLI)
  - Guide to adding new CLI tools
  - Testing patterns
  - Common imports and utilities
  - Link to docs/api.md for full reference

**Note:** Do NOT create CLAUDE.md in scripts/ - that folder is gitignored (private)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Developer opening src/ folder immediately understands the structure
- Clear guidance on how to extend the codebase

---

## Phase 3: Notebooks Folder Structure

### 3.1 Update Setup Script for Notebooks

**Goal:** Create correct notebook folder structure for new users

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Ensure `setup.sh` creates `notebooks/` directory
- [ ] Create `notebooks/updates/` for CSV exports (Fidelity, etc.)
- [ ] Do NOT create `notebooks/tools-needed/` (this is private development folder)
- [ ] Add `.gitkeep` files to preserve empty directories in git

**Required Folder Structure:**
```
notebooks/
├── updates/           # User uploads broker CSV exports here
│   └── .gitkeep
└── retirement-accounts/  # For retirement account CSVs
    └── .gitkeep
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Fresh clone + setup.sh creates correct structure
- No private/development folders exposed
