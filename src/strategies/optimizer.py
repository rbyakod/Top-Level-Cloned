2. Risk Parity - Equal risk contribution from each asset
3. Minimum Variance - Lowest risk portfolio (defensive)
4. Maximum Sharpe - Best risk-adjusted return (aggressive)

    Multi-method portfolio optimizer.

    WHAT: Calculates optimal asset allocation using various optimization techniques
    WHY: Provides validated, type-safe portfolio optimization for Finance Guru agents
    HOW: Uses Pydantic models for inputs/outputs, scipy for optimization, numpy/pandas for calculations

    EDUCATIONAL NOTE:
    Portfolio optimization is the science of allocating capital to maximize
    risk-adjusted returns. Different methods suit different investment goals:

    1. **Mean-Variance**: For investors with specific return targets
       - Pro: Intuitive, balances return vs risk
       - Con: Requires return forecasts (notoriously unreliable!)

    2. **Risk Parity**: For "all-weather" portfolios
       - Pro: No return forecasts needed, stable allocations
       - Con: Ignores return expectations, may underperform in bull markets

    3. **Minimum Variance**: For conservative capital preservation
       - Pro: Lowest risk, stable in volatile markets
       - Con: May sacrifice returns, can be too defensive

    4. **Maximum Sharpe**: For aggressive risk-adjusted growth
       - Pro: Optimal risk-adjusted returns, mathematically elegant
       - Con: Sensitive to input estimates, can be concentrated

    5. **Black-Litterman**: For incorporating specific views
       - Pro: Handles uncertainty well, combines equilibrium + views
       - Con: Complex, requires understanding of market equilibrium

    For most retail investors with $500k, Maximum Sharpe or Risk Parity
    are good starting points.

        This is the Nobel Prize-winning approach (Markowitz, 1952).
        It finds the portfolio with the lowest risk for a given return target,
        or the maximum return for a given risk level.

        WHY IT WORKS:
        - Diversification reduces risk (portfolio volatility < weighted avg)
        - Math finds the optimal balance between assets
        - Correlation matters: uncorrelated assets = better diversification

        Risk Parity Optimization (Equal Risk Contribution).

        CONCEPT:
        Each asset contributes EQUALLY to total portfolio risk.

        FORMULA:
        Risk contribution_i = w_i × (Σw)_i / σ_portfolio

        Where:
            - w_i = weight of asset i
            - (Σw)_i = marginal contribution of asset i to portfolio variance
            - σ_portfolio = portfolio standard deviation

        Goal: Make all risk contributions equal

        EDUCATIONAL NOTE:
        Risk Parity was popularized by Bridgewater's "All Weather" portfolio.
        The key insight: equal DOLLAR allocation ≠ equal RISK allocation.

        EXAMPLE:
        Portfolio with stocks and bonds (equal $):
            - Stocks: 50% of dollars, ~90% of risk (high volatility)
            - Bonds: 50% of dollars, ~10% of risk (low volatility)

        Risk Parity would allocate MORE to bonds to equalize risk contributions.

        WHY IT'S POPULAR:
        - No return forecasts needed (avoids biggest uncertainty!)
        - More stable allocations (less turnover)
        - Performs well across market regimes
        - Good for "all-weather" portfolios

        LIMITATION:
        - Ignores return expectations (may underweight high-return assets)
        - Can be too conservative in bull markets

        This finds the lowest-risk allocation possible, ignoring returns entirely.

        WHY USE THIS:
        - Capital preservation is priority #1
        - Volatile market conditions (defensive positioning)
        - Approaching retirement (can't afford losses)
        - Complement to aggressive strategies (safe bucket)

        HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE:
        Minimum variance portfolios have surprisingly good risk-adjusted returns!
        Research shows they often beat market-cap weighted indices over long periods.
        This is called the "low volatility anomaly" - lower risk doesn't always
        mean lower returns.

        FOR YOUR $500K:
        If you're risk-averse or in volatile times, this is your friend.

        Maximum Sharpe Ratio Optimization.

        FORMULA:

        Where:
            - μ = expected returns vector

            - w = portfolio weights

        EDUCATIONAL NOTE:
        The Sharpe ratio measures return per unit of risk. Maximizing it finds
        the portfolio with the best risk-adjusted returns.

        GRAPHICALLY:
        On the efficient frontier, this is where a line from the risk-free rate
        is tangent to the frontier. This is called the "tangency portfolio"
        or "market portfolio" (in CAPM theory).

        WHY IT'S POPULAR:
        - Mathematically optimal risk-adjusted returns
        - Intuitive: maximize bang for buck (return per unit of risk)
        - Used by professional portfolio managers
        - Works well for growth-oriented investors

        LIMITATIONS:
        - Requires return estimates (garbage in, garbage out!)
        - Can be concentrated (puts all eggs in best baskets)
        - Sensitive to estimate errors (small input change = big allocation change)

        RECOMMENDATION:
        Great for investors who:
        - Have strong return views (e.g., conviction in specific stocks)

        Black-Litterman Model Optimization.

        CONCEPT:
        Combines market equilibrium returns with investor-specific views
        to produce more stable, intuitive allocations than pure Markowitz.

        FORMULA (simplified):
        Posterior returns = [(τΣ)^-1 + P^T Ω^-1 P]^-1 [(τΣ)^-1 π + P^T Ω^-1 Q]

        Where:
            - π = market equilibrium returns (from reverse optimization)
            - Σ = covariance matrix
            - P = view selection matrix (which assets views apply to)
            - Q = view returns (your expected returns for specific assets)
            - Ω = view uncertainty matrix (confidence in views)
            - τ = scaling factor (typically 0.025-0.05)

        EDUCATIONAL NOTE:
        Black-Litterman solves a major problem with Markowitz:
        Small changes in return estimates → huge changes in allocations

        WHY THIS HAPPENS:
        Optimizer exploits tiny differences, creating extreme concentrated bets.

        HOW BLACK-LITTERMAN FIXES IT:
        1. Start with market equilibrium (market cap weights imply expected returns)
        2. Blend in your specific views with appropriate confidence
        3. Uncertainty is explicitly modeled → more stable allocations

        EXAMPLE FOR YOUR $500K:
        Market equilibrium might suggest:
            - SPY: 10% return, 16% vol
            - TSLA: 12% return, 40% vol

        You think TSLA will do 20% (bullish view).

        Black-Litterman blends:
            - Your view: 20% (but accounts for uncertainty)
            - Market equilibrium: 12%
            - Result: Maybe 15% (weighted by confidence)

        Then optimizes using blended returns → more stable allocation.

        WHEN TO USE:
        - You have specific investment opinions (views on certain stocks)
        - Want to incorporate views without extreme concentration
        - Need stable allocations (less turnover = lower trading costs)

        Generate efficient frontier for visualization.

        EDUCATIONAL NOTE:
        The efficient frontier shows all optimal portfolios across risk levels.
        Each point represents maximum return for a given risk level.

        USE CASES:
        - Visualize risk-return tradeoff
        - Help choose appropriate risk level
        - Show diversification benefits graphically
        - Client education and communication
