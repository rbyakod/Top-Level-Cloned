- Business logic and models (vanilla Swift)
- SwiftUI views with accessibility
- Modern async/await patterns
- Database operations (SQLite, CloudKit sync)

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive testing with Swift Testing
- Code review (security, performance, HIG compliance)
- Modernization (legacy to modern Swift conversion)
- Documentation generation

### Coordination
- Shared plan files for agent handoffs
- Automatic status tracking
- Clear ownership and next steps

## Prerequisites

**Sosumi MCP Server** — Required for Apple documentation lookup. Agents use this to verify modern API usage (2025). Configure in your Claude Code settings before using this plugin.

## Getting Started

1. **Install** this plugin in your Claude Code plugins directory
2. **Build a feature** by invoking agents in order (start with `@swift-architect` for new features)
3. **Agents coordinate** through plan files — no manual handoffs needed
4. **End with code review** via `@swift-code-reviewer` before shipping

For detailed workflows and examples, see [Using Agents](#using-agents) section below.

## Using Agents

This plugin provides ultra-specialized agents that you invoke directly to build features. Each agent has a specific role and understands when to hand off to the next agent in the workflow.

### Basic Workflow: Building a TCA Feature

For a typical feature using The Composable Architecture:

**Step 1: Plan the architecture**
```
@swift-architect Design a counter feature with increment/decrement buttons using TCA
```
This creates a plan file at `docs/plans/counter.md` with architecture decisions.

**Step 2: Design TCA architecture**
```
@tca-architect Design the state, actions, and effects for the counter based on the plan
```
Updates the plan with TCA-specific design details.

**Step 3: Implement the reducer**
```
@tca-engineer Implement the counter reducer and effects following the TCA design
```
Creates the actual Reducer implementation.

**Step 4: Create SwiftUI views**
```
@swiftui-specialist Create the counter view that displays the state and handles actions
```
Implements the UI without mixing in business logic.

**Step 5: Write tests**
```
@swift-test-creator Write comprehensive tests for the counter using Swift Testing
```
Creates test files with test cases.

**Step 6: Code review and verification**
```
@swift-code-reviewer Review the implementation for quality, security, and performance
```
Verifies code meets project standards before shipping.

### Alternative Workflow: Vanilla Swift Feature (No TCA)

For simpler features without complex state management:

**Step 1: Plan architecture**
```
@swift-architect Design a calculator utility (vanilla Swift, no UI)
```

**Step 2: Implement core logic**
```
@swift-engineer Implement the calculator logic following the plan
```

**Step 3: Write tests**
```
@swift-test-creator Write tests for the calculator using Swift Testing
```

**Step 4: Code review**
```
@swift-code-reviewer Review the implementation for quality and performance
```

### Common Tasks by Agent

| Task | Agent | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Analyze UI mockups/screenshots | `@swift-ui-design` | Analyze this design mockup and create UI specifications |
| Plan new features | `@swift-architect` | Plan a user authentication system |
| Design TCA architecture | `@tca-architect` | Design state/actions/effects for authentication |
| Implement TCA features | `@tca-engineer` | Implement the authentication reducer |
| Implement vanilla Swift | `@swift-engineer` | Implement the Settings model and persistence |
| Build SwiftUI views | `@swiftui-specialist` | Create the authentication UI following the design |
| Create tests | `@swift-test-creator` | Write tests for the authentication flow |
| Code review | `@swift-code-reviewer` | Review the authentication module for security and quality |
| Modernize code | `@swift-modernizer` | Migrate this legacy code to async/await |
| Documentation | `@swift-documenter` | Document the public API surface |
| Project docs | `@documentation-generator` | Create comprehensive project documentation |
| Fast code search | `@search` | Find all UserDefaults usage in the codebase |
| Code review | `@swift-code-reviewer` | Review the implementation for quality and security |

### Plan File Coordination

All agents coordinate through a shared plan file at `docs/plans/<feature-name>.md`. This file:
- Records architecture decisions (created by `@swift-architect`)
- Tracks implementation status
- Contains handoff notes from each agent to the next
- Ensures continuity across agent handoffs

Each agent will automatically read the plan, update it with their work, and add notes for the next agent.

### Key Principles

- **Start with `@swift-architect`** for new features to get architecture decisions
- **Use `@swift-ui-design`** if you have mockups or screenshots to analyze
- **Choose your path** — TCA for complex state, vanilla Swift for simpler features
- **Always end with `@swift-code-reviewer`** to verify quality before shipping
- **Agents coordinate via plan files** — No manual handoff needed, just invoke the next agent

## Advanced Features

### Helper Scripts

**get-recent-simulator.sh**

Gets the most recent iOS simulator available for Xcode builds.

Usage:
```bash
bash scripts/get-recent-simulator.sh
```

Used by build automation to select the correct simulator for testing.

**bump-plugin-version.sh**

Automates version bumping across plugin metadata files.

Usage:
```bash
bash scripts/bump-plugin-version.sh <new-version>
```

This script updates version numbers in:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- Any other version-managed files

### Development Rules

**five-whys.md**

Root cause analysis technique for debugging complex issues:
- Structured approach to dig deeper into problems
- Leads to systemic improvements rather than symptoms
- Useful for understanding agent failures and design decisions

**thinking-partner.md**

Collaborative problem-solving approach for design decisions and complex architecture questions.

## Installation

### Local Development
Drop this folder into your Claude Code plugins directory:

```bash
~/.claude/plugins/swift-engineering/
```

Then in Claude Code:
```
/plugin reload
```

### Configuration
Before using agents, ensure the **Sosumi MCP Server** is configured in your Claude Code settings for Apple documentation lookup.

Optional: Configure hooks for git automation. See [hooks-scripts/README.md](hooks-scripts/README.md) for details.

### First Run
1. Navigate to your Swift project directory
2. Invoke an agent: `@swift-architect Design a new feature`
3. Agent creates a plan file at `docs/plans/<feature-name>.md`
4. Each subsequent agent updates the plan and adds handoff notes

## Agent Handoff Model

Each agent knows exactly when to hand off:

| From | To | Condition |
|------|----|-----------|
| @swift-ui-design | @swift-architect | UI analysis complete |
| @swift-architect | @tca-architect | TCA architecture chosen |
| @swift-architect | @swift-engineer | Vanilla architecture chosen |
| @tca-architect | @tca-engineer | TCA design complete |
| @tca-engineer | @swiftui-specialist | Implementation complete |
| @swift-engineer | @swiftui-specialist | Implementation complete |
| @swiftui-specialist | @swift-test-creator | Views complete |
| @swift-test-creator | @swift-code-reviewer | Tests written |
| @swift-code-reviewer | @swift-documenter | Code review complete |

## Plan File Format

All agents share state via a plan file at `docs/plans/<feature-name>.md`:

```markdown
# Feature: <FeatureName>

## Status
- [ ] UI design (@swift-ui-design)
- [ ] Architecture (@swift-architect)
- [ ] TCA design (@tca-architect) — if TCA
- [ ] Implementation (@tca-engineer or @swift-engineer)
- [ ] Views (@swiftui-specialist)
- [ ] Tests (@swift-test-creator)
- [ ] Code review (@swift-code-reviewer)
- [ ] Documentation (@swift-documenter)

## MCP Servers
- **sosumi** — Apple documentation lookup (2025 APIs)

## Handoff Log

### @agent-name (YYYY-MM-DD)
**Work done:** [Summary]
**Files created:** [List]
**Notes for next agent:** [Context]
**Next:** @agent-name — [Reason]
```

## Architecture Conventions

- **iOS 26.0+** minimum deployment target
- **Swift 6.2** with strict concurrency checking
- **SwiftUI only** (no UIKit unless explicitly requested)
- **TCA** for complex state management, vanilla Swift for simpler features
- **SQLite** for persistence (never SwiftData)
- **Swift Testing** framework (no XCTest)
- **async/await** exclusively (no completion handlers)

## Model Usage

| Model | Agents | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Opus | @swift-architect, @swift-ui-design, @tca-architect | Best reasoning for architecture decisions |
| Inherit | Implementation agents (engineer, test, review, modernizer, docs) | Balanced quality and cost (uses parent session model) |
| Haiku | @search, @swift-documenter | Fast, efficient for mechanical tasks |

## Quality Assurance
