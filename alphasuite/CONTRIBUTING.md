# Contributing to AlphaSuite

First off, thank you for considering contributing to AlphaSuite! It's people like you that make open-source projects such a great place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contribution, no matter how small, is greatly appreciated.

This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [AlphaSuite Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing code and documentation to submitting bug reports and feature requests.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/rsandx/AlphaSuite/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue on GitHub. This allows for a discussion of your idea before you start working on it.

### Submitting Pull Requests

Ready to contribute some code? Great! Here’s how to set up AlphaSuite for local development and submit your changes.

## Development Setup

1.  Fork the `AlphaSuite` repository on GitHub.
2.  Clone your fork locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_name_here/AlphaSuite.git
    ```
3.  Follow the installation and setup instructions in the main README.md to create your virtual environment and install dependencies.
4.  Create a new branch for your local development:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```
    Now you can make your changes locally.

## Pull Request Process

1.  When you're done making changes, ensure your code follows the project's style guidelines.
2.  Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add a new awesome feature"
    ```
3.  Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```
4.  Open a pull request to the `main` branch of the `rsandx/AlphaSuite` repository.
5.  Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you've made and why.

## Contributing a New Trading Strategy

One of the best ways to contribute to AlphaSuite is by adding a new trading strategy. The platform is designed to make this as easy as possible.

The core idea is to create a self-contained Python file in the `strategies/` directory that defines a class inheriting from `BaseStrategy`. The system will automatically discover and load it.

For a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to structure your strategy file and implement the required methods, please refer to the **"Adding a New Trading Strategy"** section in the main README.md. We've provided a comprehensive breakdown of each required method with examples.

## Contributing a New Scanner

Similar to strategies, you can extend the platform's capabilities by adding custom market scanners. The Market Scanner page is designed to automatically discover and load any new scanner you create.

The process involves creating a self-contained Python file in the `scanners/` directory that defines a class inheriting from `BaseScanner`.

For a complete guide on how to create a scanner, define its parameters, and implement its logic, please see the **"Adding a New Scanner"** section in the main README.md.

We are excited to see what new strategies you come up with!
